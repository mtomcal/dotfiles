# Session Summary: Add zsh Detection to Install Script
**Date**: 2025-10-27

## 1. Primary Request and Intent
The user ran the install.sh script for macOS and encountered an issue with the shell-changing step. Since macOS already uses zsh as the default shell, the user requested adding detection logic to the install.sh script to skip the shell change operation if zsh is already the default shell.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts
- Shell detection and comparison using $SHELL environment variable
- basename command for extracting shell name from full path
- chsh command for changing default shell
- macOS vs Ubuntu differences in shell handling
- Bash scripting conditionals and path handling

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### /home/mtomcal/dotfiles/install.sh (lines 179-201)
- This is the main installation script for the dotfiles repository
- Modified the shell-changing logic to detect if zsh is already the default
- Original code compared full paths which could fail: `if [ "$SHELL" != "$(which zsh)" ]`
- New implementation:

```bash
# Set zsh as default shell if not already
CURRENT_SHELL=$(basename "$SHELL")
if [ "$CURRENT_SHELL" != "zsh" ]; then
    print_info "Current shell is $CURRENT_SHELL, changing to zsh..."

    ZSH_PATH=$(which zsh)
    if [ -z "$ZSH_PATH" ]; then
        print_error "zsh not found in PATH"
        exit 1
    fi

    if [ "$OS" == "macos" ]; then
        # macOS uses chsh differently
        chsh -s "$ZSH_PATH"
    else
        # Ubuntu
        chsh -s "$ZSH_PATH"
    fi

    print_success "Default shell set to zsh (restart required)"
else
    print_success "zsh is already the default shell"
fi
```

**Key improvements**:
- Uses basename to extract shell name
- Adds informative success message when zsh is already default
- Adds error handling if zsh is not found in PATH

## 4. Problem Solving

**Problem**: The install script was attempting to change the shell to zsh even when zsh was already the default shell on macOS

**Root Cause**: Path comparison (`$SHELL` vs `$(which zsh)`) could fail if the paths were formatted differently or pointed to different zsh installations

**Solution**: Changed to extract just the shell name using `basename "$SHELL"` and compare it to "zsh" string, making the detection more reliable and shell-agnostic

**Result**: Script now correctly detects when zsh is already the default and skips the shell change operation with an appropriate success message

## 5. Pending Tasks
None. The requested feature has been successfully implemented.

## 6. Current Work
Just completed the modification to /home/mtomcal/dotfiles/install.sh to add zsh detection logic. The change was made at lines 179-201, replacing the simple path comparison with a more robust basename-based detection that extracts just the shell name and compares it to "zsh". This ensures that on macOS (where zsh is often the default) and any other system where zsh is already configured, the script will detect this and skip the shell change operation, displaying "zsh is already the default shell" instead.

## 7. Optional Next Step
No next steps required. The user's request has been fully completed. The install.sh script now properly detects when zsh is already the default shell and skips the change operation accordingly.

### Direct Quote from Conversation
**User**: "I ran the install for mac os and so far so good except for changing shell. I already have zsh for mac default shell. Can you add detection for install.sh and to skip that if zsh is already there"

**Assistant**: "Perfect! I've updated the install.sh script to detect if zsh is already the default shell before attempting to change it."
