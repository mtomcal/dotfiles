# Session Summary: Tmux Default Session Fix
**Date**: 2025-10-25

## 1. Primary Request and Intent
The user wanted to change their default tmux session that automatically attaches when they SSH into their machine. They had an active team session but the system was automatically attaching to a different session ("default") instead. The goal was to configure the SSH auto-attach to use their team session instead.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts
- tmux session management and auto-attach on SSH
- Shell configuration loading order (.zshrc vs custom dotfiles)
- SSH_CONNECTION environment variable for detecting SSH sessions
- Shell sourcing and configuration precedence
- Dotfiles repository structure and management

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `/home/mtomcal/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom`
- Custom ZSH configuration file managed in dotfiles repository
- Contains tmux auto-attach logic for SSH connections
- Modified line 27 from `tmux attach -t default || tmux new -s default` to `tmux attach -t 1 || tmux new -s 1`

```bash
# Start tmux on login (skip if already in tmux or not in SSH)
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [[ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
  # Attach to existing session or create new one
  tmux attach -t 1 || tmux new -s 1
fi
```

### `/home/mtomcal/.zshrc`
- Main ZSH configuration file
- Sources the custom dotfiles config at lines 136-137
- Had duplicate tmux auto-attach logic at lines 122-126 that was causing the issue
- Commented out the duplicate block and added explanatory note:

```bash
# Start tmux on login (skip if already in tmux or not in SSH)
# NOTE: This is now handled in ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom
# if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [[ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
#   # Attach to existing session or create new one
#   tmux attach -t default || tmux new -s default
# fi
```

### `/home/mtomcal/dotfiles/tmux/.tmux.conf`
- Read to understand tmux configuration but not modified
- Contains vim-style keybindings, status bar configuration, and tmux+neovim integration settings

## 4. Problem Solving

### Initial Problem
User's SSH sessions were auto-attaching to "default" session instead of their team session

### First Attempt
Modified `/home/mtomcal/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom` to attach to session "1" instead of "default"

### Problem Persisted
Change didn't take effect because there was duplicate auto-attach logic

### Root Cause
Discovered duplicate tmux auto-attach code in `~/.zshrc` (line 125) that was executing before the dotfiles custom config was sourced

### Solution
Commented out the duplicate code in `~/.zshrc` so only the dotfiles version controls auto-attach behavior

### Status
Fix implemented, user needs to run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply changes

## 5. Pending Tasks
- User needs to run `source ~/.zshrc` in their terminal to apply the configuration changes
- User should test by opening a new SSH connection to verify session "1" auto-attaches correctly

## 6. Current Work
The final work completed was commenting out the duplicate tmux auto-attach logic in `/home/mtomcal/.zshrc`. The duplicate code at lines 122-126 was causing the system to attach to "default" session before the dotfiles custom configuration could run. I replaced the active code block with a commented-out version and added a note explaining that this functionality is now handled in `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom`. The user was instructed to run `source ~/.zshrc` to reload their shell configuration and make the changes take effect.

## 7. Optional Next Step
No further action needed. The task is complete. The user should test the changes by running `source ~/.zshrc` and then opening a new SSH connection to verify that session "1" automatically attaches.

## 8. Direct Quotes

**User**: "this doesn't work it still attaches to default"

**Assistant**: "Aha! There's the problem. You have **two** tmux auto-attach commands:
1. Line 125 in `~/.zshrc` - attaches to "default"
2. Line 27 in `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom` - attaches to "1" (which we just updated)

The one in `.zshrc` (line 125) is running first and attaching to "default" before the custom config even loads."

**User**: "yes" (approving to comment out the duplicate)

**Assistant**: "Perfect! I've commented out the duplicate tmux auto-attach code in `~/.zshrc`. Now reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

The next time you SSH in, it should automatically attach to session "1" instead of "default". The tmux auto-attach logic is now only in `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom` where it belongs."

## Technical Details

### Tmux Sessions Discovered
- Session "1": 3 windows, currently attached (the team session)
- Session "default": 1 window, not attached

### Configuration Loading Order
1. `~/.zshrc` loads first (Oh My Zsh configuration)
2. `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc.custom` sourced at end of .zshrc (lines 136-137)
3. Duplicate auto-attach in .zshrc was running before custom config, causing the issue
