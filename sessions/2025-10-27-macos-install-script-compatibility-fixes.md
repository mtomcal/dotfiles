# Session Summary: macOS Install Script Compatibility Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

- User reported a macOS error when running `./install.sh` from their dotfiles repository
- The error occurred during neovim configuration when trying to uncomment the custom plugins import line using `sed -i`
- Error message: "sed: 1: "/Users/mtomcal/.config/ ...": invalid command code m"
- User requested either a fix to install.sh or diagnostic commands to investigate the issue
- User then proactively asked to identify and fix any other potential macOS compatibility issues in the script

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- BSD sed (macOS) vs GNU sed (Linux) syntax differences for in-place editing
- sed -i flag requires empty string argument (`''`) on BSD/macOS but not on Linux
- Platform detection in bash scripts using `$OS` variable
- Symlink-based dotfiles management architecture
- kickstart.nvim two-layer configuration (base + custom)
- Bash script idempotency and cross-platform compatibility
- grep -oP (Perl regex) is GNU-specific and not available on BSD/macOS

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### /home/mtomcal/dotfiles/install.sh (primary file modified)

**Why important**: Main installation script for dotfiles setup, must work on both Ubuntu and macOS

#### Fix #1 - sed compatibility (lines 397-406)

```bash
# Check if the import line is commented out
if grep -q "^  -- { import = 'custom.plugins' }," "$HOME/.config/nvim/init.lua"; then
    # Uncomment the import line using sed (handle macOS vs Linux differences)
    if [ "$OS" == "macos" ]; then
        sed -i '' "s/^  -- { import = 'custom\.plugins' },/  { import = 'custom.plugins' },/" "$HOME/.config/nvim/init.lua"
    else
        sed -i "s/^  -- { import = 'custom\.plugins' },/  { import = 'custom.plugins' },/" "$HOME/.config/nvim/init.lua"
    fi
    print_success "Custom plugin loading enabled"
```

Changed from single `sed -i` command to platform-conditional execution

#### Fix #2 - Missing print_header function (lines 35-37)

```bash
print_header() {
    echo -e "${BLUE}[INFO]${NC} $1"
}
```

Added missing function that was being called at line 436 but never defined

### /home/mtomcal/dotfiles/AGENTS.md (read for context)

**Why important**: Provides AI agent guidance about repository architecture and conventions

- Confirmed the install script architecture: OS detection, symlink strategy, two-layer neovim config
- Noted existing platform-specific handling patterns and common pitfalls

## 4. Problem Solving

### Problem 1 (SOLVED): sed command failing on macOS during neovim configuration

- **Root cause**: BSD sed requires `-i ''` syntax while GNU sed uses `-i`
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to use correct sed syntax based on detected OS
- **Impact**: This was the actual error the user experienced

### Problem 2 (SOLVED): Undefined function causing potential script failure

- **Root cause**: Line 436 calls `print_header()` but function was never defined
- **Solution**: Added print_header function definition alongside other print_* functions
- **Impact**: Would have caused script to fail after neovim setup completes

### Problem 3 (INVESTIGATED - NO FIX NEEDED): grep -oP usage at line 146

- **Issue**: Perl regex flag (-oP) not supported by BSD grep
- **Status**: Code is inside `if [ "$OS" == "ubuntu" ]` block, so never executes on macOS
- **Note**: Would be problematic if code structure changes in future

### Other compatibility checks (VERIFIED OK)

- ln symlink commands use portable `-sf` flags
- echo append operations (`>>`) compatible on both platforms
- date command uses portable format
- read prompts use compatible syntax

## 5. Pending Tasks

- User needs to commit and push the fixes to their dotfiles repository
- User needs to pull changes on their Mac
- User needs to re-run `./install.sh` on macOS to verify fixes work

## 6. Current Work

Immediately before the /save-session request, I had just completed a comprehensive macOS compatibility audit of the install.sh script. I provided a detailed summary documenting:

- The two bugs fixed (sed syntax and missing print_header function)
- One issue investigated but not requiring a fix (grep -oP in Ubuntu-only code)
- Multiple compatibility checks that passed
- Clear action items for the user to commit, push, pull, and re-run the script

The work was concluded with this summary statement: "The two bugs I fixed would have caused failures during the neovim configuration and Claude Code setup phases. Both are now resolved!"

## 7. Optional Next Step

No next steps required. The task has been completed:

- Both macOS compatibility bugs have been identified and fixed
- Additional proactive compatibility audit completed with all checks passing
- User has clear instructions to commit/push changes and re-test on their Mac

The conversation concluded with my statement: "The script should now complete successfully!" and "The two bugs I fixed would have caused failures during the neovim configuration and Claude Code setup phases. Both are now resolved!"

If the user re-runs the script and encounters any new issues, I would be ready to help troubleshoot, but no further work is pending at this time.

## 8. Direct Quotes from Recent Conversation

User's question:
> "Will there be any other issues like this we should get in front of on macos?"

My response:
> "Yes! I found **one more issue** that will cause problems on macOS."

My final summary:
> "I found and fixed **2 issues** that would cause problems on macOS... The two bugs I fixed would have caused failures during the neovim configuration and Claude Code setup phases. Both are now resolved!"

My action items for user:
> "1. **Commit and push these fixes** to your dotfiles repo 2. **Pull on your Mac** and re-run `./install.sh` 3. The script should now complete successfully!"

## Summary of Changes

### install.sh modifications:

1. **Lines 35-37**: Added missing `print_header()` function
2. **Lines 399-404**: Added platform-specific sed command handling for macOS vs Linux

Both changes ensure the install script runs successfully on macOS without errors.
