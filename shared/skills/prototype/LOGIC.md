# Logic Prototype

A tiny interactive terminal app that lets the user drive a state model by hand. Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape** — the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once you push it through real cases.

## When this is the right shape

- "I'm not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where the user wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is "what should this look like" — wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down what state model and what question you're prototyping. One paragraph, in the prototype's README or a comment at the top of the file. A logic prototype that answers the wrong question is pure waste — make the question explicit so it can be checked later, whether the user is watching now or returning to it AFK.

### 2. Pick the language

Use whatever the host project uses. If the project has no obvious runtime (e.g. a docs repo), ask.

Match the project's existing conventions for tooling — don't add a new package manager or runtime just for the prototype.

### 3. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the actual logic—the bit answering the question—behind a small, pure interface, with the throwaway TUI around it. This separation makes the idea and useful code easy to evaluate for deliberate absorption later, but the logic module remains prototype code until it passes normal production implementation and verification.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer** — `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine** — explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no implicit current state — just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, *not* whichever is easiest to wire to a TUI. Keep it pure: no I/O, no terminal code, no `console.log` for control flow. The TUI imports it and calls into it; nothing flows the other direction.

This separation makes the prototype's evidence useful past its own lifetime. When the question is answered, delete the TUI shell. Delete the logic by default too; deliberately absorb any useful portion only through the host repository's normal production implementation and verification.

### 4. Build the smallest TUI that exposes the state

Build it as a **lightweight TUI** — on every tick, clear the screen (`console.clear()` / `print("\033[2J\033[H")` / equivalent) and re-render the whole frame. The user should always see one stable view, not an ever-growing scrollback.

Each frame has two parts, in this order:

1. **Current state**, pretty-printed and diff-friendly (one field per line, or formatted JSON). Use **bold** for field names or section headers and **dim** for less important context (timestamps, IDs, derived values). Native ANSI escape codes are fine — `\x1b[1m` bold, `\x1b[2m` dim, `\x1b[0m` reset. No need to pull in a styling library unless one is already in the project.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**, listed at the bottom: `[a] add user [d] delete user [t] tick clock [q] quit`. Bold the key, dim the description, or vice-versa — whatever reads cleanly.

Behaviour:

1. **Initialise state** — a single in-memory object/struct. Render the first frame on start.
2. **Read one keystroke (or one line)** at a time, dispatch to a handler that mutates state.
3. **Re-render** the full frame after every action — don't append, replace.
4. **Loop until quit.**

The whole frame should fit on one screen.

### 5. Make it runnable in one command

Add a script to the project's existing task runner (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `pyproject.toml`) and give the user its exact one-command invocation so they never need to remember a source path.

If the host project has no task runner, put one exact direct command at the top of the prototype's README. Do not add a runtime or task runner only for the prototype.

### 6. Hand it over

Give the user the run command. They'll drive it themselves; the interesting moments are when they say "wait, that shouldn't be possible" or "huh, I assumed X would be different" — those are the bugs in the _idea_, which is the whole point. If they want new actions added, add them. Prototypes evolve.

### 7. Capture the answer

When the prototype has done its job, capture the answer before cleanup. If the user is around, ask what it taught them. If not, leave a `NOTES.md` next to the prototype so the question, verdict, evidence, and implications can be filled in (or fill them in if you observed the session). Then follow the router's delete-by-default or deliberate-absorption contract.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't add tests.** A prototype that needs tests is no longer a prototype.
- **Don't wire it to the real database.** Use an in-memory store unless the question is specifically about persistence.
- **Don't generalise.** No "what if we wanted to support X later." The prototype answers one question.
- **Don't blur the logic and the TUI together.** If the reducer / state machine references `console.log`, prompts, or terminal escape codes, it's no longer portable. Keep the TUI as a thin shell over a pure module.
- **Don't ship prototype code as production code.** Delete the hand-driven TUI shell. Pure logic may be worth deliberately absorbing, but only through normal production implementation and verification.
